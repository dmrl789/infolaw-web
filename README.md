# InfoLAW.net – Legal Reasoning for AI, Fair Utility Rewards

**Tagline**: A curated, machine-readable library of legal reasoning authored by jurists where contributions are rewarded with utility tokens fairly for AI legal agents and legal research tools.

## What InfoLAW is
InfoLAW.net is a vertical legal knowledge hub built to ensure jurist contributions remain machine-readable and properly rewarded. Jurists, scholars, and law firms publish structured legal articles, essays, case breakdowns, and datasets where every entry follows an AI-readable schema: facts → issues → rules → analysis → conclusion, accompanied by jurisdictional and temporal metadata. Buyers—including AI research teams and legal departments—license this reasoning in a marketplace model with transparent pricing so contributions can later be rewarded with utility tokens fairly. All contributions can be hashed and timestamped via HashTimer to establish authorship provenance.

## Who it is for
- **Jurists & scholars** who want to monetize their reasoning while maintaining attribution.
- **Law firms & legal departments** seeking structured knowledge bases and due diligence accelerators.
- **AI legal agent builders & legaltech startups** needing machine-readable training corpora and benchmarks.
- **Universities, courts, and research institutes** exploring transparent datasets for comparative or policy research.

## What you can do with it
- Publish deep legal analyses, datasets, and reasoning templates that AI systems can ingest immediately.
- Discover curated corpora filtered by jurisdiction, topic, or outcome, with clear licensing terms.
- License articles, subscribe to premium feeds, or fund bounties for missing datasets with transparent, utility-token-aligned pricing.
- Anchor contributions for verifiable authorship, enabling courts or auditors to trust the chain of custody.

## Why utility tokens
- **Native settlement layer**: Every transaction—per-article, per-dataset, or subscription—is designed to flow through utility tokens so contributors are rewarded fairly with low fees.
- **On-chain provenance**: Content hashes and timestamps can be anchored via HashTimer to prove authorship and publication time.
- **Micro-transaction friendly**: A tokenized approach allows micro-payments for granular content access, unlocking new pricing models for legal knowledge.

## Roadmap (Phase 0 → Phase 4)
1. **Phase 0 – Concept & UX**: Define the mission, product vision, and initial landing page structure.
2. **Phase 1 – MVP Content + Static Landing Page**: Publish foundational essays/datasets, ship a static site explaining the marketplace.
3. **Phase 2 – Utility Token Rewards + Content Anchoring**: Integrate wallets, enable HashTimer anchoring for all submissions.
4. **Phase 3 – API for AI Agents + Marketplace / Bounties**: Launch structured data APIs, enable bounty contracts, and automated payouts via utility tokens.
5. **Phase 4 – Governance, Reputation, and Advanced AI Integration**: Introduce jurist councils, staking-based reputation, and deeper integration with AI assistants operating on top of transparent utility token mechanics.

## Development

This repository now hosts the Phase 1 marketing site for InfoLAW.net, implemented with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.
