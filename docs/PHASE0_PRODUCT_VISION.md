# InfoLAW.net – Phase 0 Product Vision

## 1. Mission
InfoLAW.net bridges legal expertise and AI systems by making jurist-authored reasoning machine-readable, verifiable, and tradable. Every contribution is structured for AI ingestion and transacted in IPN, the utility token of the IPPAN network, aligning incentives for authors, reviewers, and AI consumers.

## 2. Target Users & Use Cases
### 2.1 Jurists / scholars
- **Why they join**: Turn legal scholarship, litigation experience, and policy analysis into ongoing IPN revenue while keeping provenance of their work.
- **What they publish**: Structured essays, case breakdowns, comparative law notes, argument graphs, and datasets tagged by jurisdiction and doctrine.
- **How they earn IPN**: Per-article unlocks, recurring subscriptions to their collections, and bounty rewards for custom datasets or reasoning templates.

### 2.2 AI teams / legaltech
- **How they use InfoLAW**: Source high-quality training data, evaluation sets, and legal reasoning templates to fine-tune models or build inference chains.
- **Example**: Feed InfoLAW negligence datasets into a legal LLM to power CounselAI’s advice engine, or use structured GDPR analyses to benchmark compliance bots.

### 2.3 Law firms / institutions
- **Use cases**: Build internal knowledge bases, accelerate compliance research, and benchmark AI assistants before deployment. Courts and universities can source transparent datasets for moot courts, policy studies, or AI audits.

## 3. Content Types (AI-first)
- **Reasoned opinions & essays** following the facts → issues → rules → analysis → conclusion format, plus metadata on jurisdiction, court level, and citation graph.
- **Case breakdown datasets** decomposing judgments into labeled components for supervised learning.
- **Legal argument graphs** with nodes representing propositions and edges indicating support, contradiction, or distinction.
- **Legal reasoning templates/patterns** capturing reusable logic flows for doctrines like negligence, GDPR breach analysis, or constitutional proportionality.
- **Benchmarks / datasets for AI evaluation** focused on issue spotting, outcome prediction, and statutory interpretation tests.

## 4. Economics in IPN
- **Pay-per-article / dataset**: Buyers unlock individual items using IPN micro-payments.
- **Subscription plans**: Collections and topical feeds available through monthly IPN subscriptions.
- **Bounties**: AI teams post IPN-funded requests for missing jurisdictions, case types, or evaluation sets.
- **Revenue sharing**: IPN flows split between authors, peer reviewers, and the platform fee wallet, all traceable on IPPAN.

## 5. Trust & Quality
- **Verified jurist profiles**: Bar registrations, academic affiliations, and previous publications verified before earning badges.
- **Peer review system**: Reviewers stake time, earn IPN rewards, and their assessments feed into public quality scores.
- **Reputation scores**: Weighted by successful downloads, positive reviews, and adherence to schema requirements.
- **Dispute resolution**: Escrowed IPN with arbitration rules for conflicts over originality, accuracy, or delivery of commissioned datasets.

## 6. Technical Integration (High-Level)
- **API endpoints (future)**: Query structured content by jurisdiction, topic, or content type; retrieve reasoning graphs; subscribe to webhook updates.
- **Use of IPPAN**: IPN handles all settlement; HashTimer anchors hashes of submissions and updates to prove integrity and timing; future smart contracts could automate bounty payouts.

## 7. Phase 0 Deliverables
- Updated README describing InfoLAW’s concept and roadmap.
- This product vision document outlining mission, users, content, economics, trust, and tech integration.
